This Faith mage lacks the desired hourglass shape that some women have, her narrow shoulders tapering down into her thin waist that accentuates her hips and gives her more of a pear shape than anything else. She is blessed with long legs bound in fair peachy flesh and she walks with a poised air about her, platinum blonde locks almost considered as “white” falling around her body that makes her appear a tad bit darker than she really is.
<br><br>
Kina has distinct facial features somewhat European in origin with perfect symmetry. Her cheekbones are high and proud, her face ovular with a defined jawline and a rounded chin. Kina’s lips are plump and pink, complementing the shades of pink that decorate her cheeks and nose. Her eyes are almond shaped and are a startling shade of sky blue that are often described as piercing but with an odd sense of warmth about them.

Kina has come a very long way from the start of her Ulreich journey, having gone through hard losses and proud gains over the past several years that has turned her into the woman she is now. She viewed Ulreich as a means of escape and had about her a strong sense of ambition. She wanted to become the strongest mage anyone had ever seen while still being only sixteen at the time. She was incredibly temperamental and antagonistic to her peers until people walked into her life that changed her permanently.
<br><br>
After the loss of her love interest, a good friend, and several respected peers, Kina’s views on life and priorities changed. She now strives to uphold peace amongst her fellow students and will do whatever she can to help someone in need regardless of whether or not she gains anything from it. However she is not above fighting for what she believes is right, especially if it keeps those she loves out of harm’s way.

The Earth Warden's Life Thus Far

Across the vast Multiverse spawned another world, an identical twin to the commonly referred to “New World”, their timelines aligned perfectly from the rise and fall of prehistoric creatures to the birth of mankind and their varying forms of religion. Not one being, otherworldly or native, could foretell the creation of a mutated plague that spread its devouring maw throughout Europe and most commonly affected humans and animals with low forms of immune systems. Children who had just been born or were still in infancy were attacked the most, as well as the elderly and those with immune deficiency disorders, and hundreds of thousands of lives were lost just before the Renaissance era began.
<br><br>
It had killed off many of the great artists as they were born, forming a new timeline where there would be /no/ great artistic revolution. However, as people scrambled to find some sort of way to defend themselves and their children from this disease they struck innovative gold. Medicines were made, ones unlike any other previously created, that utilized new forms of technology and allowed the Humans to formulate a cure. Once they realized what they had done and the possibilities these inventions opened up, everyone was hustling to create new things and improve their lives. This gave way to a massive technological boom, kickstarting a world that no one from the time could ever have imagined.
<br><br>
New inventions brought with it a better understanding of themselves and the world around them, even leading to the rediscovery of mana and magic which had been long forgotten as humans were coming to power. Now with magic in their arsenal, wars began to spring up like wildfire as nations made a mad-dash for power, taking lives so high in number that it couldn’t be accurately recorded. Land was destroyed and some places even became uninhabitable similarly to if a radioactive nuclear meltdown had occurred in the aftermath of each warzone. While not enough mana had been used to birth Corruption into the world, the circumstances were almost perfect to start breeding it like another disease that could cause countless more deaths. 
<br>
Once magical scholars and researchers realized this to be the case they forced an immediate cease-fire between all warring nations so that Practitioners of Faith magic could stay the rapidly developing magical cancer’s growth. It was promptly explained to the nations’ leaders that a magical war would only bring about their untimely demise and quite literally the destruction of their planet. They were thankfully able to see reason  and agreed to call off their battles to usher in an era of peace.
<br><br>
Without the worries of any world wars, as every single nation had agreed to the terms of the hastily-made peace treaty, life finally began to flourish once more under the influence of magic and mundane items mixing for an ultimately more fulfilling lifestyle for the average human. Flash forward to present-day society, the picture was like a science-fiction novel since this rapidly expanding race had a several-hundred-year early kickstart to all of the things “New World” humans had achieved.
<br><br>
It was on the sunny day of April 3, deep in the upper echelons of London’s high society, that a child was born under B.T.N. (British Technological Navy) Officer Alice Buvelle and Medical Scientist Laverne Buvelle. The infant girl was named Kina, a peculiar name for a peculiar child, with a head of platinum blonde hair like her mother and piercing blue eyes like her father. They took the babe home as soon as they could, life appearing like a paradise which only got better once the girl displayed a talent for the art of Faith healing. Proud and excited for her future, funds for higher education were immediately set in stone while they waited for Kina to be old enough to get enrolled into the best private institution possible.
<br><br>
Alice had secured herself enough time to get Kina up to her first year of school until she had to return to work that would take her to various places overseas for long periods at a time. The B.T.N. was a branch of the British Military that oversaw Sea Warfare and was always pushing for the exploration of the sea floor through the help of underwater machines crafted out of magic-enhanced metal alloys that were highly resistant to underwater pressure. This left her Father as the only parental figure that could regularly be found around the house, sacrificing any and all sources of research money to acquire a day job from which he could come home to his daughter and raise her as best he could while her Mother was away. This caused the relationships to tip in the favor of Laverne, the relationship between Alice and Kina dwindling into nothing since, well… she was never there. Kina didn’t /hate/ her Mother by any means, it was just that since they’d only interacted in her earliest years of growth, all of the necessary parental services required to get the girl through early adolescence was missed out on and thus there was no connective bond.
<br><br>
She was taught well and had many friends, but whenever breaks came around and they returned back to school she’d always hear them talking about what wondrous and memorable times they had with their families whereas Kina had no such experiences. For reasons unknown to her, after Alice had gone back into Military service she’d come home for the holidays with a sour mood that spoiled any forms of festivities. There was always arguing, her Mother barraging her Father with verbal abuse sometimes so intense that Kina feared she might strike the man until he couldn’t handle it and got himself a divorce which separated all ties from the family.
<br><br>
Kina wasn’t granted the ability to visit her dad as Alice manipulated corrupt judges to refuse them the right to associate with one another no matter how much she pleaded. Eventually no one came around for the holidays, or even at all, until all Kina had left was a elderly caretaker in that sad and closed house. Without anyone there to be supportive of her and her studies, the Faith mage withdrew herself from them and the only thing she could talk to were paintings and pictures of memories from happier times.
<br><br>
Life went by in grayscale for her for years until a few short days had passed after she’d reached her 15th birthday when news was plastered all over R.T.V. (think everyday Television just through realistic hologram-esque images) that struck the girl like someone had caught her flesh with a hot iron; Alice Buvelle, now stripped of her title of Officer, had bargained with unknown forces falsified incriminating evidence that the United Kingdom had been testing nuclear bombs laced with volatile mana that created a devastating war weapon. So much mana radiation leaked from the zones where these bombs were tested in sparse areas in Russia and Norway that it caused newborns and developing young children to develop grotesque mutations. 
<br><br>
Russia and Norway had no choice but to initiate declarations of war, the larger nations of the United States and Germany banding together in an attempt to end the conflict before too much damage could be done but achieved next to nothing as Alice immediately went about securing all of Britain under her magical iron first. However, what she couldn’t account for was that her own people were disgusted with her actions and fought back, a rebellion forcing the Witch out of their towns and cities and back into London where she could hide behind walls constructed both out magic and technology, bolstered by the mana pools of mages scattered throughout the continent that made it virtually impossible to break through without getting through what the woman called her “Inner Circle” first.
<br><br>
The final resistance battle held outside the fields of Dover (where Kina had been sequestered to as the war effort moved north) just a few hours away from London hosted so much mana in the air that it teetered on the edge of becoming a festering ground for minor traces of Corruption. Without any people to rid the world of it this time as they were all preoccupied with different things, the world itself found a way to adapt. A tether reached across the Multiverse until it connected with a world capable of forming a direct link to its own, a rift spawning in the forest surrounding the city that began feeding the magic energy into this new world. 
<br><br>
A very distraught Kina fled into the forest in the aftermath of the battle, the girl stumbling upon the rift. She gazed upon its surface, looking at the picture of a place unknown to her, and jumped through. While probably not the best idea given it could have taken her anywhere, she thought it a way to escape her troubles to an extent it sort of did.

High Archmage Medium
</div>
<div id="medium">
<b>The Dazzling Barricade</b>
<br>
Upon achieving High Archmage rank, Kina sought out her trusted Enchantress friend Gossamer to reforge her High Mage Medium. The material was worked into the new shape of a simple golden metal vambrace that travels the length of Kina’s forearm, the Titanium metal having been melted down with new alloy, effectively “reforging” by using pieces of the old in the new that increased its strength to that of Diamond has acquired several new abilities while retaining those previously held before being reforged. “Faith specific buffs cast through the Medium have a one rotation increase on their durations (NOTE: Given the unfortunate circumstances of this Medium’s approval, it has been agreed on that this may also apply to her Archmage Faith buffs as well). Faith defensive constructs may also be up to five feet further away from her before deactivating from being too far. For Geomancy, the size of her constructs are increased by 2x, and Kina is able to double cast any of her Geomancy barriers when under the effects of the Medium by costing double mana.
<br><i>Peacekeeper</i>
<br>An incredibly useful feature, the wristband is capable of expanding from the sides of the vambrace into the shape of her old 5x5foot shield that has been... improved. With the expense of a chunk of mana, Kina may cause the shield to split from the center, the aforementioned mana coming between the spaces and solidifying into a Diamond-grade barrier. Although not actually “breaking” the old shield, bonds of Earth Warden mana connect the center mass of the shield which will remain attached to the vambrace to the four corners of the square-shaped shield, each corner adorned with a quarter of the old shield’s material (which doesn’t actually provide anything useful that part is just aesthetic).
<br>While in this mode the shield is capable of defending against two attacks of equal strength, but double the amount of mana can be woven into the shield to force it to expand to double its normal size and weight. This means that when it grows past its normal size, the barrier may only be moved if something of at LEAST x4 strength is (or equivalent) is doing the moving. Something to be noted is that, since Faith is the primary part of this barrier and it is not meant to be used offensively, the entirety of the shield is able to protect against one secondary effect assuming the secondary effect is of the surface’s durability rank or less. This excludes secondary effects implemented thanks to special/specific mana types. When the construct breaks, the dispersed shield parts retract back into the vambrace to reform itself.
<br><i>Warden's Wrath</i>
<br>While in Peacekeeper mode, the defensive construct that forms upon being activated gains access to a particularly unique ability. Only affecting rock shards created by her Shattering Light spell, she has the power to turn them into specialized mediums capable of being used to cast any known defensive (Kina has to see them and they have to be within the twenty five foot radius that the spell creates for this to work) Earth Warden, Faith, or Geomancy spell approved before the Medium’s. However, doing so requires a hefty chunk of mana to maintain and will destroy the shard on use. In order to use this ability the shards can’t be being used in any offensive sense; shot off as projectiles, etc. Does not act as a range extender, meaning that the shard has to be within the barrier’s normal range of her to be used to cast the spell. Shards being sacrificed for barrier spells only happen one at a time so Kina can’t activate a bunch at once. Limits her to one barrier per rotation.
<br>Any barrier created via the sacrifice of a rock shard from Shattering Light will withhold a primary influence of Geomancy mana upon it. What this means is that -- even if said barrier is a FAITH ONLY spell -- it will be considered a partial creation of geomancy; power level and additional aspects of faith may still apply, but the technique will be susceptible in contact with opposing spells that hold special effects or power advantages to geological mana. For example, if a rock shard is used to create a barrier that is typically considered to be comprised of solely faith mana, an opposing spell that has increased damage against geomancy will still receive the damage boost. Likewise, if an enemy Geomancer possesses the ability to manipulate other geomantical constructs to a certain degree, these barriers will not be exempt. This also works in reverse; spells that are weak or ineffective to Geomancy will also find themselves lacking against faith barriers cast in this manner.

Archmage Abilities

<div id="archmagespells">
  <h1>Archmage Spells</h1>
  <b>Gaia's Shield</b>
  <br>Erects a physical barrier that is twenty feet wide and tall in a horizontal dome shape. While being cast, the direction that she's facing that front of the dome will form in two layers - A faith and an earthen layer making it much stronger at the front than at the back where they combine and mix into just one. The barrier has a Tungsten durability and may be destroyed through two attacks of equal rank towards the front and is reduced to only one attack at the back side. May also take multiple Titanium-grade attacks. Once destroyed, the barrier cracks and explodes, releasing sharp iron-grade shrapnel of rock in a fifteen foot radius away from her in the direction that she is facing that can pierce iron defenses. However, these rock shards may be coated in a hard outer shell of defensive mana as a means to protect the constructs within equal to Tungsten in strength. Unable to be controlled into a singular direction, these lack the shotgun effect that would make them able to collectively destroy an equal strength barrier but may individually pierce Titanium constructs. These do not affect selective targets within Kina’s line of sight (meaning she has to know the ally is there) so long as they are not more than 15 feet away from her. The exploding effect may be triggered if the barrier is cracked or damaged but not destroyed yet
  <br><br>
  <b>Gift of Stone</b>
  <br>A powerful buff that increases the physical strength of those it is cast upon by 3x, capping out at 5x overall. By using the strength of earth and the power of Faith barriers, this spell is capable of increasing the target’s durability up to Tungsten, allowing them to block two attacks of equal strength but can protect them from harm when being attacked by several spells of lower ranking. This buff may be cast on up to two people, both higher and lower ranking than she, and the durability buff scales to the mage’s appropriate rank, but caps out at tungsten. While still being able to buff a max ranking mage, this durability increase will only scale up to Tungsten rather than diamond at its current standing. When used on more than one person, the durability cap will go down by one level, meaning that if she buffs herself and a max ranking mage, both of them will acquire a Titanium durability increase rather than a Titanium and Tungsten one. A special part of this spell causes the entire surface of the barrier (the whole body of the person buffed) to protect against one secondary effect, assuming the secondary effect is of the surface’s durability rank or less. This excludes secondary effects implemented thanks to special/specific mana types.This buff lasts for four posts and goes on a one post cooldown after being cast, those affected with Gift of Stone are required to stay within 40 feet of Kina in order to retain their buff.
  <br><br>
  <b>Rapture</b>
  <br>Allowing her mana to build up in the pit of her chest, a dim light appears which grows in size and brightness until it completely enveloping her body in it. This light is bright enough to ward off non-magic darkness for up to fifteen feet around her and is hard to look at directly without sustaining minor eye damage. After building up for one post, this mana can be expelled in an omnidrectional burst with such a force that it knocks targets of up to twice the strength of an average human fifteen feet on the ground. This is increased to a full thirty feet if they are flying through the air, and reduced to ten if they are anchoring themselves to the ground in some way. Rapture has a thirty foot radius. This burst does not do damage, more or less a push to clear crowds. Selective targets -- capping out at five -- may receive minor healing to the extent of a twisted ankle. On the flip side, though, Kina may choose up to four places in which one individual iron-grade spike may be formed as the burst is released within Rapture’s blast radius, but has to be looking in the direction that the spikes are going to rise from and are all three feet in length, jutting out from the ground at awkward angles rather than straight up.
  <br><br>
  <b>Purify</b>
  <br>Due to the melding of her pre-Archmage mana types, Kina's mana has taken the next step towards the ultimate goal of removing corruption. By releasing this mana type through her palms, she is able to cast a cleansing spell more powerful than her base Cleanse. This spell is capable of both curing cursed items of up to High Mage rank as long as she is aware of it ( 1 rotation for curses of ranks lower than HM, 2 for HM curses and requires constant contact with the cursed item ), and may even very slowly and with much effort begin to remove corruption from nonbiological earth-based substances as well as battle low and minor traces of corruption from fellow students/patients (can be more effective for heavier corruption damage but will HEAVILY drain mana through multiple casts). This won't regenerate limbs lost or any of the damage that the corruption did to the host, but it will certainly help the cause. ( Works on High Mage rank or lower for DM'd monsters ) Purify can not be used to cure corrupt fiends but may work on the corruption that they spread. Using this spell will always leave her feeling exhausted and may only be used on corrupt patients/cursed items/corrupted earth. Will not affect essence-based corruption or corruption that is formed out of pure energy to any extent.
  <br><br>
  <b>Earth's Beating Heart</b>
  <br>Kina draws from the very essence that the magic world beneath her feet offers from its core, channeling it from the ground and into her palms. The act of pulling the power from the soil will cause the ground to begin to lightly rumble in response in a twelve foot radius around her. Particles of what seem to be golden specs appear to be manifesting itself out of the dirt gravitate towards her, surrounding her like a beacon while she charges the spell. It’s certainly noticeable but definitely can not harm structures or disrupt movement. With the mana coalesced in her hands, they begin to glow a muted shade that appears to be a mix of gold and brown, making for a color that is easy on the eyes and oddly natural. Through physical contact only, she may let this mana flow into a severely injured target and will begin to stitch together torn flesh, muscles, broken bones, as well as regrow up to one limb per cast, over a short period of time. A healing spell powerful enough to bring back a creature from the very brink of death, but may not revive in any way a deceased target. Earth’s Beating Heart is also able to remove harmful entities from the body ( I.E. curses, poisons, bacteria. Does not affect soul-based damage.) so long as she is aware of these things and is of high enough rank to dispel them. This spell is used at a high physical cost, as well as mana. Using this will leave her feeling exhausted and sweating and takes a large chunk out of her mana pool. This spell takes one post to charge and then may be cast on the second post.
  <br><br>
  <h1>High Archmage Spells</h1>
  <b>Upgrade to: Gaia's Shield</b>
  <br>Erects a physical barrier that is twenty feet wide and tall in a horizontal dome shape. While being cast, the direction that she's facing that front of the dome will form in two layers - A faith and an earthen layer making it much stronger at the front than at the back where they combine and mix into just one. The barrier has a Diamond durability and may be destroyed through two attacks of equal rank towards the front and is reduced to only one attack at the back side. May also take multiple Tungsten-grade attacks. Once destroyed, the barrier cracks and explodes, releasing sharp iron-grade shrapnel of rock in a 20 foot radius away from her in the direction she is facing that can pierce iron defenses. However, these rock shards may be coated in a hard outer shell of defensive mana as a means to protect the constructs within equal to Diamond in strength. Unable to be controlled into a singular direction, these lack the shotgun effect that would make them able to collectively destroy an equal strength barrier but may individually pierce Tungsten constructs. These do not affect selective targets within Kina’s line of sight (meaning she has to know the ally is there) so long as they are not more than 15 feet away from her. The exploding effect may be triggered if the barrier is cracked or damaged but not destroyed yet.
  <br><br>
  <b>Upgrade to: Earth's Beating Heart</b>
  <br>Kina draws from the very essence that the magic world beneath her feet offers from its core, channeling it from the ground and into her palms. The act of pulling the power from the soil will cause the ground to begin to lightly rumble in response in a twelve foot radius around her. Particles of what seem to be golden specs appear to be manifesting itself out of the dirt gravitate towards her, surrounding her like a beacon while she charges the spell. It’s certainly noticeable but definitely can not harm structures or disrupt movement. With the mana coalesced in her hands, they begin to glow a muted shade that appears to be a mix of gold and brown, making for a color that is easy on the eyes and oddly natural. Through physical contact only, she may let this mana flow into a severely injured target and will begin to stitch together torn flesh, muscles, broken bones, as well as regrow up to one limb per cast, over a short period of time. Earth’s Beating Heart is also able to remove harmful entities from the body ( I.E. curses, poisons, bacteria, etc. [does not include corruption] ) that she is aware of and are Post High Mage rank 2 strength (for example, if she has a patient with two max rank curses on them, each individual one would require its own casting of the spell to successfully cleanse). 
  <br>Once she achieved High Archmage rank this spell gained immense power. Earth’s Beating Heart may now be used as a revival spell! In order to do so, the Earth Warden must weave the spell into the corpse of a student to begin healing it, regenerating limbs, organs, etc. until the body becomes perfectly healthy. Revival outside of combat can be done in one rotation and implied to take a long time, however in combat, or in zones where combat is actively going on, how much healing is needed will determine the number of rotations required. If the corpse has no injury and is simply dead then revival may be done in one rotation. If the body is battered or viciously ripped apart then healing will need to be done on the first rotation, and revival on the second. If the soul also requires healing (and Kina CAN provide it based on the aforementioned limitations) then the soul will need to be mended for a rotation, then the body on another, then the revival can commence on the final. At the most it’ll take three rotations, and at the least it will take one. For a revival to be successful Kina must keep physical contact with her patient during its entire duration, if she loses physical contact with them at any point in the process then all progress is lost and she’ll have to start over. 
  <br><i>(Not Purchased -- Requires 300 points)</i>
  <br><br>
  <b>Shattering Light</b>
  <br>For this spell, Kina must charge for one post, uninterrupted by outside forces such as incoming spells. After charging, she releases a powerful burst of Earth Warden mana from her feet, flooding the ground around her in a twenty five foot radius. As this happens in four different spots within this zone a large, fifteen foot tall spike of iron durability stone will shoot out from the ground with cracks that visibly pour out a soothing golden light. These spikes will remain for one post until they explode, releasing iron-grade shrapnel that are then coated in a diamond-grade barrier in a twenty five radius around each individual spike. The shrapnel are capable of individually piercing Titanium and collectively piercing through Tungsten, but allied targets will remain unharmed if they are nearby. Such allied targets will instead be surrounded by the rock fragments, at a maximum of five per person (at a maximum of four people), which swarm their entire body. The soccer ball sized fragments can be chosen by Kina to gift the bearer of them Fortitude, a physical enhancement buff which increases strength/speed/endurance by 1.5x and doubles their pain tolerance for four posts while also being infused with a magic countering barrier spell of High Archmage rank (the shards). Those who have the buff and are equipped with fragments must remain in the 25 foot radius zone Kina creates in order to be unharmed by the shards, or even be candidates for the “buff” associated with them, and to retain their buff. Kina must be actively aware of allies within her zone for them to be unharmed and/or candidates. On command, the holder may send these fragments in a straight line of their choosing (meaning that they have to actually target a specific area to use them) at a sprinting speed or command them all to hover in a singular area, unable to control them past that, and if they come into contact with a spell of up to Post High Mage rank 1 (depending on spell strength) the spell will be defended against which will also destroy the fragments used. Firing the shards (even on a straight path) is not possible unless the user is within 45 of the caster themselves.
  <br>Individual shards used in the “buff” on allies can counter a single spell of Post High Mage Rank 1 (in the same way a barrier would counter a spell) if the shard makes contact with the spell. This does not apply for Post High Mage Rank 1 spells that have been charged for multiple rotations before being cast. All five shards must be used against the same Post High Mage Rank 2 spell for them to succeed in countering it. With area of effect spells, they will not counter the entire thing, simply passing through it and tanking whatever they come into contact with assuming that the spell isn’t too strong and to cancel it completely they have to make physical contact with the source. This is a similar case for magically enhanced items (Enchanted items, Ritualism spells, Wizardry Artifacts, specialized Mediums, etc etc) spells where the mage imbues an object with their mana. In order to counter a spell like that, area of effect or not, the shards must physically come into contact with the source: I.E. the rune being used ( unless engraved into the body ) and the item which is enchanted to actually affect it. This will not affect energy based spells (does not include spells which have no solid form such as Aeromancy spells) or Unity Summons/Puppets. This will, however, be especially good against Necromancy summons of up to Post High Mage rank 1. If a shard can embed itself into a Necromancy summon of Post High Mage rank 1 or less without being destroyed or destroying the summon altogether, then Kina herself can expend more mana with that shard as a conduit and use powerful “cleansing/healing” power from her Faith magic to destroy it. This will also destroy the shard, and she is incapable of doing so if the shard is more than 50 feet away from her.

  <b>Fortitude</b>
  <br>
  Blesses an ally target, increasing their physical abilities by 1.5x ( strength, endurance, vitality, speed ) and also doubles their pain tolerance. Lasts for five posts.Caps at 3x. Required to be within 25 feet to remain buffed. Requires direct physical or magical contact to buff people.
  <br><br>
  <h1>High Mage Spells</h1>
  <b>Heal</b>
  <br>By projecting her mana through the palms of her hands, she floods the recipients body with white mana. The mana mends broken bones, internal bleeding, flesh wounds, and the like. The larger and more devastating the wound, the more mana the spell takes. This can not regenerate lost limbs.
  <br><br>
  <b>Cleanse</b>
  <br>Another spell transmitted via touch. Cleanse targets both magic and physical ailments such as induced blindness, poisons, curses, and other effects. This spell can only cure spells equal to or less than Kina's rank. Does not affect spells she has no knowledge of.
  <br><br>
  <b>Angelic Bulwark</b>
  <br>
  By extending mana from their core the caster may create a dimly lit golden bubble around themselves capable of reaching 10 feet wide and tall. The barrier itself is made out of Titanium magical construct walls specially designed to allow spells to be cast from within the bubble but prevent them from coming inside. The Bulwark is capable of defending against two equal strength attacks at any point of its smooth dome before breaking and is completely solid when trying to come INTO the bubble.
  <br><br>
  <b>Sanctuary</b>
  <br>
  Sending a burst of Faith mana into the ground, Kina blesses it in a thirty foot radius around her body, causing the ground to crack in a spiderweb pattern with light bursting from the cracks. While coating the bodies of selected targets whom are bathed in said light, it surrounds their body in a skin-tight suit of highly flexible and durable faith mana which acts as a defensive barrier. A maximum of five targets may be affected by this barrier at one time so long as they stay within the radius of the spell, and it gets progressively stronger depending on how many people it is being cast on while varying in overall mana cost for the same reason. I.E. 2 people get titanium-grade barriers, three people will get cobalt barriers, and five people will all get steel barriers. Each barrier may absorb up to two attacks of its respective durability before breaking, and while affected by a barrier the target will receive a visionary buff that allows them to see through lesser ranking darkness also based on the strength of their shield ( lower grade barriers can see through darkness of their own durability rank or lower for up to an extra ten feet in front of them in complete darkness regardless of their barrier strength. ) Like the visionary buff, the spell itself emits a light which can pierce through darkness of equal rank or lower, unable to do so through stronger darkness, and will illuminate the area a good few feet around each crack just enough to be allow for basic -- albeit limited -- vision.
  <br><br>
  <b>Infusion</b>
  <br>
  At the expense of the caster’s own mana by charging for one post and releasing it in a burst in a twenty foot radius around her, those hit will acquire a buff that allows them to use mana more efficiently, to use more spells without wasting as much mana. Infusion drops the average casting cost of the user’s next spells cast by one rank if below High Mage, or even two ranks if the user is equal to or below Mage rank. Infusion may affect up to four people at one time, who all have to stay within a thirty foot radius of the caster to keep their buff. This buff lasts for four posts, and rather than just buffing their next spell, it reduces the cost of all future spells cast while this buff is active on them, and requires one post to cool down.
  <br><br>
  <b>Apotheosis</b>
  <br>
  A powerful buff that may be applied to defensive barriers, rather than a person, this spell causes a strong barrier over a pre-existing one through required contact with it via one of her own spells or direct contact with her body. This barrier allows the previous one to absorb up to two extra attacks of High Mage ranking before breaking. The caster may spread this buff across two separate barriers, but this will only be able to give each individual defensive construct one stack of the buff. I.E. 1 shield - 2 Titanium attacks. 2 shields - 1 Titanium attack each. If the caster leaves a fifteen foot radius of the buffed barrier then the buff will deactivate prematurely. Apotheosis lasts for four posts and then goes on a two post cool down timer.
  <br><br>
  <h1>Post High Mage Spells</h1>
  <b>Sensory Pulse</b>
  <br>
  By releasing a pulse of faith mana into the target, the spell works like echolocation. The mana bounces off of every part of them and returns to Kina, allowing her to "see" any internal and external injuries such as internal bleeding, respiratory problems, etc. This spells works to find both physical and magic induced problems and is able to detect harmful spells of up to HM+ rank. Does not detect spells that are intentionally hidden by the caster.

This wall is six feet tall, four feet wide and three feet thick. The wall formed may only be up to Iron in strength, and when using pre-existing materials that are not this strong will then be coated in a layer of mana that increases it up to Iron strength rather than being below.

  Akin to her Wall spell, Kina must first select a singular point within a fifteen foot radius of her current position before manifesting her geomancy mana into a physical form. This time, it takes the shape of a sharp, jagged conic spike constructed of iron-grade rock. This spike is three feet in diameter at the base, but at its maximum height of five feet it ends in a sharp point capable of piercing straight through iron-grade constructs. These spikes last for two posts before automatically breaking down but may be retracted on command and extended once again but only in the original path that it had.
  <br><br>
  <b>Earthen Needles</b>
  <br>
  Manifests the caster’s Geomancy mana into a physical form, taking on the shape of a jagged needle of iron-grade rock. These needles are equal to iron in strength and are capable of piercing through iron constructs. Earthen Needles are projectiles which travel at up to twenty miles per hour as well as being able to travel for up to thirty feet and up to four may be summoned at a time. They last for two posts before automatically breaking down.
  <br><br>
  <b>Sandstorm</b>
  <br>
  By expelling torrents of sand from the palms of her hand, she manipulates the sand created and whirls it around her body like a twister along with any debris it can pick up. This spell is capable of dealing light skin damage once per post, and heavily reducing eyesight for up to thirty feet from her. Sandstorm lasts for three posts but requires to be channeled for one post while emitting sand from the palms.
  <br><br>
  <b>Rock Armament</b>
  <br>
  Focusing her mana around her fists, she wills it to become her tree's respective physical element: Rock. This causes rock to form around her fists, molding to the shape of her hands to form large gauntlets of solid stone which have the durability of Iron. She is able to flex her hands within the gauntlet, which in turn causes the gauntlet to follow her movements like any other normal set of gloves. If she is able to connect a solid punch, the weight behind the punch could easily break bones. The gauntlets are easily fourty each, but to her they feel closer to ten pounds. Can break through Iron defenses with multiple hits.
  <br><br>
  <b>Seeking Stone</b>
  <br>
  Requiring a great deal of focus and energy, the caster begins to manipulate the ground beneath them (so long as the surface they are touching does not exceed iron in strength) to cave in and open up like a tunnel. This begins slowly and exponentially grows in speed over one post, allowing the caster to reach depths of up to ten feet under the ground and expand the tunnel to fit up to two people side by side at once. While not having a set distance the tunnel may go, it takes a hefty chunk of mana once per post to steadily maintain all of the moved soil. However, by expanding extra mana the caster may make the soil lock together into a solid around the roof of the tunnel and increase it’s durability to iron. This allows the tunnel to take one attack of iron durability before it begins to collapse. Seeking Stone lasts for a maximum of two posts before it begins to automatically collapse. Anything standing inside of it when it collapses will quickly be crushed underneath the weight of it.

Universal Spells
</div>
<div id="universalspells">
  <b>Mana Weave</b>
  <br>
  The simple act of moving one's mana pool through their own body. Channeling one's mana
  <br><br>
  <b>Mana Spark</b>
  <br>
  A basic mana projectile that can be used offensively or defensively. It causes no real damage other than a small sting when hit directly in the flesh.
  <br><br>
  <b>Mana Pane</b>
  <br>
  When focusing one's mana before them and swirling it in a vortex quickly and violently, one may allow their mana to harden, causing a thin pane to form. This spell can only be used defensively and the power it can block is minimal, ranking at iron toughness. This spell can be learned by anyone of mage rank and above, but upon reaching high mage, one may cast two of these at a time, one for each hand.
  <br><br>
  <b>Mana Beacon</b>
  <br>
This spell is cast by concentrating on one's mind and projecting mana outwards like a sudden flash of light. Although this does not produce any visual effects, it sends a beacon-like pulse of mana outwards from ones body which can be picked up an interpreted by other mages who have learned this spell. It does not convey any message, rather a simple alarm. This can be used to send a cry for help to people within a set area of your character.
  <br><br>
  <b>Spirit Beacon</b>
  <br>
  An upgrade to Mana Beacon, rather than projecting one's mana from the mind in a pulse, this requires focus to be gathered to one's very core of being until released into the world around them. It scatters outward in a pulse like Mana Beacon, but is targeted specifically at Faith Mages, Necromancers and Spiritualists, intended to only be sensed by mages who follow those trees. While it opens up the possibility of being detected over a vaster distance (still within the same chat but a considerably larger range, with some very specific exceptions), it also offers the opportunity to warn aforementioned mages that a spirit may be disconnected from the body (recently or will be soon) and will require a guide back for revival. Upon reaching Expert Mage, focusing on this spell as it is being cast will allow the caster to choose which specific type of previously listed mage (Faith, Necromancer, Spiritualist) they desire to be able to sense their beacon.
  <br><br>
  <b>Gel Sphere</b>
  <br>
  By creating a mana spark and continuing to weave your mana around the spark like a web, eventually the orb one forms will expand into a small sphere of an incredibly adhesive substance. Once casted, this spell lasts for three posts, and has a toughness of aluminum.
  <br><br>
  <b>Summon Medium</b>
  <br>
  A spell that allows a user to transport their medium from a previous location into their hands. Only one medium can be used at a time with this spell, and can include HMM's, as well as basic objects and weapons. To change one's medium, one must use it at least once before being able to actively summon it.
  <br><br>
  <b>Mana Meditation</b>
  This spell takes two posts, the first post charges the spell, the second post activates it. If a mage meditates on whatever is causing them pain or discomfort--meaning they focus their undivided attention inward or to whatever specific part of their body is hurting--and slowly weave their mana to that particular place, they will be able to activate this spell. Mana Meditation increases a mage's natural pain tolerance slightly and can calm whatever natural shock they may be experiencing, allowing them to function better. Natural shock meaning the universal spell won't work on magic based shock
  <br><br>
  <b>Mana Rehabilitation</b>
  <br>
  This spell takes two posts, the first post charges the spell, the second post activates it. If a mage temporarily focuses on whatever is causing them pain or discomfort--meaning they focus their most of their attention inward or to whatever specific part of their body is hurting or being affected by an external source--and weave their mana to that particular place, they will be able to activate this spell. Mana Rehabilitation increases a mage's natural pain tolerance by x1.5 and can calm whatever natural shock or magic based shock (spells that cause pain/shock/discomfort of up to Mage rank) that part of their body may be experiencing. (Can take a tiny bit of edge off higher ranked spells, but not very much, will mainly be ineffective to anything higher than mage rank.)
  <br><br>
  <b>Mana Parry</b>
  <br>
  In a complicated set of movements, the caster must create a solidified pane of mana upon an appendage or object, and swipe it against an incoming projectile. Upon contact, the caster has a split second to match their mana levels with the opposing spells, which causes the projectile to meld with the casters mana and remove all secondary effects from the energy. This causes the spell to fly off in a random direction, reverted to base mana but still powerful enough to do damage based on the rank of the attack. Casters who use this can only do so on spells of their rank and below, and to do so costs the exact same amount of mana as the spell in question, so one should keep this in mind before parrying anything. Projectiles that have special effects such as detonation, or abilities that can be triggered mid flight can be activated before a spell is able to be parried.
  <br><br>
  <b>Mana Retaliate</b>
  <br>
  An upgrade to Mana Parry, this technique requires the user to weave their magic into a point of contact (such as their hand or a medium) and double the amount of mana within an incoming projectile. Upon swiping the point of contact against the opposing force, the extra mana will override the attack and transform it into an orb-like blob of magic. The caster of Retaliate must push this slow-moving orb back toward them, and break it open before it makes contact with their body. This can be done by any basic projectile, such as mana parry, and will shatter the magic into three separate and more solid components. These shattered pieces are about the size of a fist, and shaped in an almost arrow-like manner; they fly at a relatively high speed in intricate and hard to follow patterns that eventually track the original attackers location for up to 60 feet away. Upon reaching five feet from their target, the three shards scatter, sending the brightest of the trio at the front of the attacker, while the other two dull projectiles attempt to pincer each of their sides. The frontal projectiles strength remains the same power as the original retaliated attack, and the two side projectiles work at about a rank lower. This cannot be used against projectiles above the casters rank.
  <br><br>
  <b>Offensive Aura Alpha</b>
  <br>
  Cast by concentrating your focus toward the very thing that gives you life. Although various creatures have vital organs in different areas, the most common place for the aura to originate from is the chest, directly in the center. For humans and other similar beings, the heart itself acts as the conduit. The caster must weave mana directly into this organ (or simply a space on the front of their chest) and allow it to spread throughout their entire body. This aura is extremely volatile in nature, and appears very similar to flames covering the beings entirety, crackling and flaring haphazardly around them.Takes two turns to cast (one turn to prepare weaving mana into the epicenter, and one post allowing the aura to fully take effect). With the aura up, it is able to provide a slight boost (x1.5) to a person's physical strength, as well as their casting speed (this does not work for spells that require multiple posts to charge), and spell damage (around x1.25 more power, does not increase the rank of spells). The aura will make a person feel extremely warm and accelerated, creatures who possess hearts and similar organs will find that they will beat extremely fast while the aura is up. This aura will last for a period of four psts, and can be upheld for another four by charging it with mana (expending the cost to bring it up over again).
  <br><br>
  <b>Utility Aura Alpha</b>
  <br>
  Cast by concentrating on the mind itself, both in a figurative and literal sense. Casters will start by weaving mana directly into their brains, allowing the aura to expand throughout their entire body, flowing directly from the top of their heads. The spell takes one post to charge, and is cast on the users next turn. The aura will take a very liquid-like appearance while this spell is cast, flowing downwards over the body in a smooth, gentle motion. The aura will glow lightly, being slightly visible in direct light, but bright enough to glow during the darkness. With the aura up, it increases a being's reflexes and overall agility. The aura will make a person feel extremely awake and alert, and increase their visual perception slightly. This aura will last for a period of four posts, and can be upheld for another four by charging it with mana (expending the cost to bring it up over again).
  <br><br>
  <b>Defensive Aura Alpha</b>
  <br>
  Cast by concentrating on the very thing that keeps you standing. In most cases, this means the caster must begin by weaving mana directly into their spine, and allow it to flow into the rest of their body. This aura takes an extremely solid and rigid appearance; it will form around your entire body like a suit of armor, and does not contain an ethereal glow, rather a shine very similar to polished metal. The spine itself will glow slightly, and pulse, causing energy to run throughout the aura. Takes two turns to cast (one turn to prepare weaving mana into the epicenter, and one post allowing the aura to fully take effect). With the aura up, it is able to provide a x1.5 defense against physical based attacks (both natural and physical mana) as well as a x1.25 defense against energy based attacks. While this aura is active, the user will become more heavy and grounded, making it much harder to stagger or knock them down. As an added bonus, the casters pain tolerance increases significantly. This aura will last for a period of four posts, and can be upheld for another four by charging it with mana (expending the cost to bring it up over again).

Mana Manipulation
</div>
<div id="universaldescription">
  <b>What is Mana Manipulation?</b>
  <br>
  The most basic class of magic, involving the direct manipulation of Mana, is available to all mages. Raw Mana is a mundane source of magic with no special qualities, but offers some level of versatility. The amount of Mana a mage is capable of replenishing or expelling is dependent on their overall level.
  <br><br>
  <b>Faith Mana</b>
  <br>
  Mana which cannot do damage in any form. This mana is usually very warm and pleasant, and sometimes even gives off relaxing scents.
  <br><br>
  <b>Earth Mana</b>
  <br>
  Mana which manifests itself as dirt, mud, dust, etc.
  <br><br>
  <b>Personalized Mana</b>
  <br>
  Kina's mana, when visible to the naked eye, appears as an aura of bright gold, yet has a thin inner and outer border of a muted shade of brown that blends perfectly into the gold hues. Browns and other nude shades can be seen as small particles drifting inside of her aura.
  <br>
  <i>
  --- Gold is a color which is associated with higher ideals, wisdom, understanding and enlightenment. It inspires knowledge, spirituality and a deep understanding of the self and the soul.
  <br>
  --- The color brown is a serious, down-to-earth color signifying stability, structure and support.</i>
